INTRODUCTION
------------
School library systems typically use legacy systems that cause both students and librarians a
hassle. Bibliofly is a modern solution to this problem that makes use of the one thing almost
every student has - a phone. By moving the school's library to the pocket of the user, accessing
the library is easier than ever. As a result, more students will be inclined to read books.

Bibliofly allows students and teachers to checkout books, place holds, and much more all from their
mobile phone. Librarians can view how their library is performing with detailed statistics that
update in real-time. Additionally, an online portal for librarians to add books and users is
available. The source code of this is available here:
https://github.com/chsfblamobileapp2018/Bibliofly-Librarian-Portal.github.io

Bibliofly was built from the ground-up with Android and Java. Custom code paired with open-source
frameworks allowed us to build a well-crafted app that is both aesthetically pleasing and functionally
robust.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
  - An Android phone running Android Lollipop (5.0) or higher
  - Device must have camera capabilities

INSTALLATION
------------
  - App is not available on the Google Play Store
  - Must be run through Android Studio

SOFTWARE USED
-------------
We used Google's Android Studio IDE for developing Android applications. We used Adobe Illustrator
to create our app's icon. Finally, we made use of Github to store our code online, as it provides
an easy way to stay on the same version of code between our members.

SOURCES
-------
We all had prior experience with Android application development before creating this app, so we 
did not need to refer to many tutorials. We referred to Stack Overflow if any questions arose.
Finally, numerous YouTube tutorials helped us gain a better understanding of some of the libraries
we use in Bibliofly.
